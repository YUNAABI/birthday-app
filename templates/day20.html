        <p>Hey....Hey I dont know whether you open this or not,I wonder where to start,Let me start by saying,THE ANSWER TO YOUR WHYS'S AND MY WHY'S.July was pretty tough for me and you,I was fighting and saying things,you were also..now let me tell you why i was like that ,I was making this website for you ,to make you happy,to express my love to surprise you ,I put my all effort,time,love,care,everything I could ever give you ,AND the big part of our fight was also this ,when I was making this you were busy at that time,with work,with friends and I was very very very disappointed ,unhappy ,angry,stressed,hatred everything ,after you got job at amazon you changed alot ,that drastic chnage i couldnt handle,I was thinking that do you love or I am just an option there are soo many worst thoughts ,you do things only when I tell you,I have 1000 of questions for you why why are you like this ,because this is not someone I falled for ,this is not someone I met on April 13 2022,soo many whys that you will get offended... What was going through my mind is that I am doing this much for him and he didnt have time to call me or text or find time for me ,you would only call or text me only when you were free .it wass like freaking hell for me ,because when we fought ,you told me things like I bought you this that.. I noted things you want and bought it for you,I asked friends about your course everything but for me it was love It was not something you can count ,I did soo many things for you I never said any of these things I did everything I can because of my love for you ...for you these little things are effort .. when i try to tell you something with love and understanding ,when i try to make you understand something ...what you did is that you only take the part you want ,you only take the offensive things and the part you want to defend and you just simply ignore the other ,it bothered me and but then i understanded things... okay i am not writing this to offend you ,or to debate ,or to defend okay soo just take a deep breath and understand just accept,listen,read ,acknowledge, keep it in your memory,this letter is not something you forget okay kunjaaaaa ,even if its filled with harsh truth about you and me it is also filled with LOVE....Do you know why I always fight... it is not because I dont love you It is because I LOVED YOU AND I AM LOVING YOU ,everyone nowadays breakup do you why because most of them dont want to fight ,not want to understand the reality ,everyone wants an easy relationship and dont want to fight for their love okay baby,...These was the reason why we were or why I was fighting the whole time and especially july but......but...... then I realized that LOVE SHOULD BE UNCONDITIONAL ,But I always loved you with conditions ,it wasn't an unconditional love, I loved you only if you text me or call me ,I loved you only if you spend time with me I loved you only if you cared for me ,I only loved you when things were only visible for me,for me if you are not putting anything why should i love you because for me if i am putting this much and you are not doing what I want ...I thought what kind of love is this....I have soo many thoughts in my mind like why is it that hard to call me or text me when friends around.... because from the begining of our relationship you were in banglore,ni padichapolum joli undayirunnapolum,you cared for me ,everything, ni kudikkumbol ene vilikkuvayirunnu enikku athu bhayakkara ishtem ayirunnu,Ni oro trip kayinju vaumbolum enodu pareyum kochu koode undayirunel resem ayane,enew kanan thonunnu miss cheyunnu,enthelam pareyavuvayirunu ,now when i text you ..You ignore most of them .. but now nothing ,i dont know if you know that you changed. Your whole life is now is your friends and work I am no where there ,I am forcing you to include me ,My trust for you is fading....(these were my thoughts okayyy kunjaaa) But I realized that this is not how love works,I understand that the love should be unconditional,i was always asking for this that but now I know that we cant compell people to do things ,its come from heart,if its come from compelling its not love its to avoid fight ,it could be because of fear.....Our way of thinking is completely different I dont know whether you understand this or it becomes a missunderstanding  you should read this more than one time....And it hurts me I loved you that way time change ...but what can i do now is that change the way ,Nothing is impossible or nothing is hard ,I changed for you u because you were not ready to change for me... But you are mistaking and missunderstand me even if I trying my hard Now onwards dont see me in a way that you saw me you told me that ninakku pediya enikku oru mess ayakkan polum ini athonum venda ,it doest mean that we dont fight okay and dont run away from the problem we face... for me i felt like the more i love the more you are drifting away from me,i know you are not happy with me ,comfortable with me   dont missunderstad .ni ninte karym kazhinju ,ninte happiness, ninte friends,ellarum kazhinja njan.... sometimes my feelings were valid because ore karym thane njan again and again karenju kenji choichittu I thought why is that you were not putting 1 % work into it ,you never promised me ,you stoped sharing your feelings with me ,you lost intrest.... but once my hari loved all my stoopid talks....it was all visible ... now everything faded,and i dont know what will be your fellings towards me after reading this ,it could change or not or you may realize things i dont know...But we are humans right it will take time to realize things accept the fact and i choose to be wise AND SORRY for EVERYTHING I done to you AND thank you for LOVING ME ,You never initiated a fight ,you never insulted me, you never disrespected me ,you never hurted me with words,you never used a bad word ,it was all me ,you were never worried if i am busy if i texted you or called you ,you were never worried with any of these AND I mistaken it for you dont love me or you are not bothered about me,you loved me with all your heart...Your love was always pure ,innocent heartful,I was mean to you ,i have said harsh words ,The whole time I was wrong Because my stupid brain always connect stoopid things And I realize my mistakes my wrong thoughts ,my wrong belifs ,the wrong connections Actually njan athyam oke understandable ayirunnu pine aathu sangadem dissapoinment ayy pinew athu dheshym ayy vashi ayy ,I was stoopid You love me ..but the problem was I didnt like the you love me that was problem but now I am trying to understand the way ,accepting it....I hurted you alott...I am hurting me alot ,sometime I feels like I am becoming mentally unstable I dont know what will be you feelings after reading this it could be hate,or you unlove me  or you understand me or you love me more or you you get hurt or you realize ,I dont know what is going to happen and I am scared AND I am really SOO SORRY FOR EVERYTHING I WISH IF YOU FORGIVE ME ....vere oru karym njan ninte vittil poy orikkalum kuttam ayy parenjattila,yes i wasnt thoughtful ninte uncle krym,but ente kochine korechu njan kuttam ayy parenjathalla amma ,ammamma ennodu choichu vilikkarille ennu appo njan aa ene vilikathenu ninew vazhakku pareyatte vicharichu parenja athu avr athrem serious ayy ninew hurtful akki vazhakku pareyum ennu swapnathill polum vicharichatilla ,Yes i talk to them but I dont know them that much ni ennodu agane scn akkum ennu onum parenjattila ,ente vittukaru egane aa ninakku ariya athu njan ninakku parenjuthannakondu allathe ithrem vallya scn avum enno kochinu ithrem hurt akki avru pareyumenno vicharichu paranja alla orikkalum alla ninew vazhakku pareyumennu mathrem ariyavayirunnu but ithrem serious issue avumennu areelayirunnu (athukondu kochu vazhakku idumbol ithu parenju jaykkann nokkallu kettoda marappattii),and until namde edel problem nadakkana vare you didnt told me that....... its hurts dearr.. how could you not share those things like with me ...you sure that you going to marry me...dont I have right to know these things kunjaaa....njan annya ahno kochinu...I never meant to hurt you understand that okay I promise I never ever meant that  And I LOVE YOU  ente kochine sangadapeduthan alla ente kochu skm adikkalu ,sangadapedellu ,veshemikkalu happy ayy oru 26 vaysu karen oru kunji 20 vayasukaride karyggal aa oru understanding sense edukkanem ..Please try to understand me also  I am also a person I became very sensitive....
